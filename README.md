#### Summary
The idea behind the project is as follows:
Lee county is organizing a county fair over the upcoming summer. You along with one
other friend plan to participate in several games including the bucket ball game. Each
player will be assigned a bucket to start with and the player that gets the bucket with the
highest worth wins the game. The worth of each bucket is calculated as per the rules
below. 

A bucket contains 10 balls of four different colors – red, blue, white, and green. Each
red is worth 10 points, each green is worth 15 points, each blue ball is worth 20 points,
and each white ball is worth 1 point. 

**You are going to write a computer program in
Scheme to look at a bucket and decide how many points it’s worth.
